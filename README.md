# **WarGlace - Marketplace for Neighborhood**

The idea of this web app is to bridging the marketplace from Whatsapp group, to the web app with simple navigation around and easy to understand for both buyer and seller. I want to focus this web app to the seller side since they will be the one who will fill the content of this app.

My goal is to make the seller **<ins>feel at ease with their store and how to manage.</ins>** Since they using _Whatsapp and Chat Group for doing the promotion_, i will initially trying to make a bot and communicate it with my backend so the content of the app will automatically filled base on what seller provide such as product name, photo, pricing, etc.

## **Basically a Chat Group Marketplace Turned into Marketplace Web**

This web app will have the capability of making store, listing product and all other things ***just by communicate with the bot's service communication*** handled by **Whatsapp's Business API** and _BPS_ (for simple configuration and maintain).

Seller will first chatting with my bot, then my bot will giving instruction for the seller to give their store's name. After that, the bot will give a menu for managing product like add a new product, edit or delete product. Each menu will have to have a full guide, but with a **minimum steps and easy to understand.**
